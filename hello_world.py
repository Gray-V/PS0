    """
    In this question (1A), you will write code that prints “Hello, World!!!” like this:
        
        ***************************************
        *                                     *
        *           Hello, World!!!           *
        *                                     *
        ***************************************

    Remember with code you need to be very precise. The output should match exactly the output above.
    You can check if it is the same by using pytest!
