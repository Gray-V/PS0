## Movie Mixup

In this problem, you will practice using terminal commands! 

Every week day, one older movie is played at the local theater. They need to move the movies to the correct folder based on the day of the week they are playing, though not all days are used.

Inside the `movie_mixup` folder, you will find multiple files and folders. The files are named after movies and the folders are named after days of the week. Based on this schedule, you will need to move the movies to the correct folder based on the day of the week they are playing.

| Day | Movie |
| -------- | -----: |
| Monday | Shrek |
| Tuesday | Barbie |
| Wednesday | Avengers |
| Thursday | Shrek |
| Friday | Jaws  |
| Saturday | *Closed for a holiday* |

For example, if the movie `The Matrix` is playing on Monday and Tuesday, you will need to make a copy of `The Matrix` file and move one to the `Monday` folder and the other to the `Tuesday` folder.

**NOTE: Make sure all steps are complete**
- All the movies are in the correct folders
- If a folder is missing, create it
- If a movie is not used, delete it
- If a movie is used more than once, make a copy
- If a folder is not used, delete it
- Remember some movies may be in the wrong folder to start
